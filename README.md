# Homework Assignment 2

**Problem 2: Expected Health Utility (Weight 1)**. 
Modify the decision tree classes we implemented in class such that 
you can also get the expected health utility of alternatives in addition to 
the expected cost. Test your code on the decision tree below and 
print the expected cost and expected health utility of nodes C1 and C3. 
(Note: first download Intro.py file from the P4_DecisionTree 
branch of the Labs_IntroOOP repository to your local hard drive so 
that you can modify them and push them to your own repository).
