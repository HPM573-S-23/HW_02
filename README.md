# Homework Assignment 2

**Problem 1: Debugging and Exception Handling (Weight 1)**. Debugging is the process of 
identifying and resolving issues ('bugs') that prevent your code from running correctly.
In this problem, you are asking to find and fix the bugs 
in the class `SumRatio` (in the file `\Debugging\SumRatio.py`).

The class `SumRatio` has a very simple task. It gets two arrays 
(x1, x2, ..., xn) and (y1, y2, ..., yn) and returns (x1/y1, x2/y2, ..., xn/yn). 
1. Find and fix the bugs in the current implementation of `SumRatio` 
such that you can run `Test1.py` script without any error. 
Toward this, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJtWxm12Eo0) 
to learn about the debugging features of PyCharm and read 
[this post](https://blog.hartleybrody.com/debugging-code-beginner/) for
some debugging tips.

**Problem 2: Expected Health Utility (Weight 1)**. 
Modify the decision tree classes we implemented in class 
(`DecisionTree.py` in this repository) such that 
you can also get the expected health utility of alternatives in addition to 
the expected cost. Test your code on the decision tree below and 
print the expected cost and expected health utility of nodes C1 and C3.
