**Problem 1: Expected Health Utility (Weight 1)**. 
Modify the decision tree classes we implemented in class 
(`DecisionTree.py` in this repository) such that 
you can also get the expected health utility of alternatives in addition to 
the expected cost. Test your code on the decision tree below and 
print the expected cost and expected health utility of nodes C1 and C3.
